## About Me

I am Yongbin Feng (冯永彬 in Chinese), an assistant professor at Department of Physics and Astronomy of Texas Tech University studying experimental particle physics (HEP-ex). More information can be found in my CV [<a href="files/cv/cv.pdf">link</a>].

For potential graduate students and postdocs interested in any of the topics of CMS data analyses, advanced calorimeter R&D (especially on the simulation and machine learning assisting reconstruction), heterogeneous computing with or without machine learning, and search for dark sector and dark matter at small fixed-target experiments, please **feel free to contact me**!

Lubbock, Texas, USA, Aug. 2024 - present
- **Postdoctoral Research Associate** at <em>Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory</em>
<br> 
Batavia, Illinois, USA, Nov. 2020 - Jul. 2024

## Education
